Objetivo: It is expected to provide a complete solution towards these challenges by creating a new ecosystem for the art keeping, trading and transferring.
Problema: The on-chain registration of collectors ofÔ¨Çine assets provides an immutable digital record of the artwork, which guarantees the true ownership, the provenance and the value of the artwork.
Metodologia: Our objective analysis and evaluation show that the ArtChain platform is applicable and practical.
Contribui√ß√£o: In this paper, we present our project work, called ArtChain, a blockchain-based art trading system, which has been piloted and operated as a working product in practice.

Arquivo: pdf//Effective_Scheme_against_51_Attack_on_Proof-of-Work_Blockchain_with_History_Weighted_Information.pdf
Objetivo: In the present paper, we introduce a new solution by utilizing a historical weighted difÔ¨Åculty to determine the total chain difÔ¨Åculty.
Problema: The mechanism in ZeroBlock requires a block to be accepted by its peers within certain time interval after the timestamp of the block.
Metodologia: Major blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are both using different variety of PoW protocol.
Contribui√ß√£o: Also, to simplify the cost estimation, here we assume that the price of mined token is close to the cost of mining such token.

Arquivo: pdf//ETH_Relay_A_Cost-efficient_Relay_for_Ethereum-based_Blockchains.pdf
Objetivo: Thus, operating a relay that requires each block header to be fully validated on submission between Ethereum-based blockchains leads to exorbitant operating cost.
Problema: In Sections VI and VII, we evaluate the proposed relay scheme with regards to security and operating cost, respectively.
Metodologia: As the name implies, Baseline acts as baseline for our experiments.
Contribui√ß√£o: Because of its ability to store data and execute code in a decentralized and immutable way, blockchain technology is seen as potentially disruptive in areas such as Ô¨Ånance [1], business process management

Objetivo: First, the traditional crowdsourcing model relies on a centralized trusted third-party platform, which directly leads to a single point of failure.
Problema: However, it is worthy of deeper discussion on the authority of the agent entity.
Metodologia: As our preliminary work, the experiment in this paper mainly focuses on the efÔ¨Åciency of PBFT consensus used on our platform.
