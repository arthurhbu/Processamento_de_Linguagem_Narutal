Arquivo: pdf//Decentralizing_Privacy_Using_Blockchain_to_Protect_Personal_Data.pdf
Objetivo: autonomous deployment of a PDS which includes a mecha- nism for returning computations on the data, thus returning answers instead of the raw data itself [6].

Arquivo: pdf//Effective_Scheme_against_51_Attack_on_Proof-of-Work_Blockchain_with_History_Weighted_Information.pdf
Objetivo: In the present paper, we introduce a new solution by utilizing a historical weighted difﬁculty to determine the total chain difﬁculty.
Problema: We demonstrate that, in reality, such an algorithm can increase the money cost and the time cost of 51% attacks by a factor of at least two orders of magnitude.
Metodologia: In the present paper, we introduce a new solution by utilizing a historical weighted difﬁculty to determine the total chain difﬁculty.

Arquivo: pdf//ETH_Relay_A_Cost-efficient_Relay_for_Ethereum-based_Blockchains.pdf
Objetivo: Thus, operating a relay that requires each block header to be fully validated on submission between Ethereum-based blockchains leads to exorbitant operating cost.
Problema: In Sections VI and VII, we evaluate the proposed relay scheme with regards to security and operating cost, respectively.
Metodologia: In future work, in an effort to reduce submission cost even further, we will investigate the feasibility of batch submis- sions of Ethereum block headers using zero-knowledge proofs similar to the approach taken by zkRelay for Bitcoin block headers.
Contribuição: Because of its ability to store data and execute code in a decentralized and immutable way, blockchain technology is seen as potentially disruptive in areas such as ﬁnance [1], business process management

Arquivo: pdf//Hawk_The_Blockchain_Model_of_Cryptography_and_Privacy-Preserving_Smart_Contracts.pdf
Objetivo: A. Hawk Overview We propose Hawk, a framework for building privacy- preserving smart contracts.
Problema: These emerging cryptocur- rency systems build atop a novel blockchain technology where miners run distributed consensus whose security is ensured if no adversary wields a large fraction of the computational (or other forms of) resource.
Metodologia: However, this paper refers to the entire protocol deﬁned by the Hawk program as a contract; and the blockchain’s program is a constituent of the bigger protocol.

Arquivo: pdf//Hybrid_Blockchain_Design_for_Privacy_Preserving_Crowdsourcing_Platform.pdf
Objetivo: First, the traditional crowdsourcing model relies on a centralized trusted third-party platform, which directly leads to a single point of failure.
Problema: Never- theless, all of these existing works ignore the scalability and transaction veriﬁcation efﬁciency of the blockchain network, limiting the performance of the crowdsourcing systems.
Metodologia: Once the answer collection stage is ﬁnished, the smart contracts compute the reward of each answer and generate a zero-knowledge proof πr with the task requester’s private key skr as the witness to commit the successful running of the reward distribution policy.
Contribuição: Then, to enhance transaction ver- iﬁcation throughput, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensuses are respectively deployed on the public chain and the subchains, and smart contracts of the public chain and the subchains are designed accordingly.

Objetivo: In such a setting,  this research presents a unique report of the performance of this  Blockchain framework in a major real-world commercial  situation.
Problema: One of the  earliest manifestations of the power of this technology is Bitcoin  which is a self-regulated currency platform capable of handling  transactions remarkably faster, safer, cheaper, and more  traceable than conventional legacy financial systems [5].
Metodologia: Also, we utilized  Locust as our testing framework for the purpose of consistency.
Contribuição: Overall, Hyperledger Iroha outperformed other  alternatives in our case because of its consensus algorithm (also  referred to as YAC or Yet-Another-Consensus algorithm),  highly supportive community, robust permission system, simple  deployment as well as ease of maintenance.
